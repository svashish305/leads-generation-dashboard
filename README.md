## Curl command to submit lead to webhook endpoint

We can use the following curl command to submit a lead to the webhook endpoint.
Webhook endpoint is `https://lead-generation.onrender.com/api/v1/webhook/<userId>` where userId denotes the webhook endpoint for that user.
The token is the one generated by the server when the user logs in, as response cookie.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://lead-generation.onrender.com/api/v1/webhook/1'   --header 'Content-Type: application/json'    --cookie 'token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTY4ODAyNTcwNCwiZXhwIjoxNjg4Mjg0OTA0fQ.To-57OI0obsc54appNczrmN1iHWo_Xl-7jnVkHBTnrk'     --data-raw '{
                "name": "Tony Stark",
                "email": "tony@avengers.com",
                "phone": "+16262223333",
                "otherFields": {
                        "address": "Avengers Headquarters",
                        "income": "A lot"
                }
        }'
```
